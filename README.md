# Programming exercises from RIT UN FERI
This repository contains programming exercises that I completed during my studies at the Faculty of Electrical Engineering and
Computer Science (FERI), University of Maribor. These projects cover various topics related to computer science, including
software development, web development and more.

## Contents
This repository is organized into subfolders, each of which corresponds to a particular subject. Within each subject you can
find programming exercises which also include source code and instructions on what should that source code do. 


## Conclusion

Throughout my studies, I will continue to add more exercises and projects to this repository, as well as further develop my
skills and knowledge in various areas of computer science.
